                        <p id="about-p">In 2009, in Reading, Pennsylvania, Sandy Solmon started baking classic American cookies
                            in a 2-bay garage. Tirelessly testing recipes and ingredients, she struck the perfect balance: a
                            harmonization of flavor, texture, and the elusive dimension of artfulness, the je ne sais quoi, that
                            separates good cookies from great ones. As her cookies caught on and the following for her small
                            production grew, Sandyâ€™s dessert portfolio expanded and Sweet Street Desserts was born.</p>
